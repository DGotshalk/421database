* Charnalyn Crivello

* Drew Gotshalk


## Technologies used:
* sqlite (https://sqlite.org/download.html)
* python 
* flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* sqlalchemy (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/index.html)
* bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)


## What needs to be done
* Add to and remove from cart (despite their being buttons in the items sections they dont add to the thing) 
* Being able to see the orders and make an order as well
* More advanced query manipulation of the tables, I was thinking fields where we could end up sorting items by name, by price, by anything really
* The actual homepage, That should be the almagamation
